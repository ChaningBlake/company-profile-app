	The purpose of the website is to help one calculate the risk of a company.
The original prototype involved the user inputting three different parameters,
which would then be used to calculate the risk, which is displayed on the
screen. To handle the backend, we used the Flask framework. Flask recieves the
input sent by the user, calculates the output, and updates the webpage with the
appropriate value. After building this model, we wanted to improve the
functionality. Using a flask extention called SQLAlchemy, we created a database
that stores data for a predetermined group of companies for the user. We changed
the UI from three input parameters to a single selection bar to make it easier
for the user. All the user needs to do is select the company he or she desires 
for the results to be calculated. On the right are four circles display the
results. One score for the risk, sale-prediction, public sentiment, and one for
the average of these three. The public sentiment is calculated using Google's
sentiment analysis API.
