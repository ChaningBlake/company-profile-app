	The purpose of the website is to help one calculate the risk of a company.
The original prototype involved the user inputting three different parameters,
which would then be used to calculate the risk, which is displayed on the
screen. To handle the backend, we used the Flask framework. Flask recieves the
input sent by the user, calculates the output, and updates the webpage with the
appropriate value.
